### Hi, I'm Eduardo! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Mobile Software Engineer, a Computer Science student, and solving problems is my passion.

I currently hold the position of Mobile Software Engineer at one of the leading payment market companies in Brazil. In my daily routine, I work in the development of scalable solutions using Swift and Kotlin Multiplatform, employing a wide range of technologies such as SwiftUI, UIKit, Combine, RXSwift, MVVM+C, async/await, XCFrameworks, XCoordinator, and XCTest.

I have over five years of experience in programming and project leadership using a variety of technologies, including Kotlin, Python, TypeScript, C, and Java, with an extensive background in full-stack development.
