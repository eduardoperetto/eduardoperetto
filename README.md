### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 - I am a Computer Science student at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (BR). I study programming since 2018 and I have been working as Developer since 2020.
 - I have experience working as full-stack Web Developer, using PHP frameworks as Yii2, and have developed several apps using Angular (JS framework) and Django (backend Python framework). I have also worked as Programming Monitor at UFRGS, where I assisted students to learn C language.
 - My favorite language is JavaScript, but I am also expanding my knowledge and learning different areas of development, such as Mobile with Swift.
 - I'm currently learning and reviewing some concepts such as APIs, backend and databases at the FreeCodeCamp platform, which I highly recommend.
 - At the moment, I'm working as iOS (Swift) Developer at Stone, a Brazilian payments fintech.
